title: Week 11 - GSoC 2020
tags: [SymPy, GSoC]

Week 11 was spent mostly on applying suggestions from code review in the Transfer function matrix PR ([19761](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19761)). Prior to week 11, I was mostly involved in implementing a bunch of
functionality but couldn't add a good set of unit tests for that. So, I added tests for construction of `Parallel` and `Series` objects with transfer function matrix in the
arguments. The `str` printing of `TransferFunctionMatrix`, `Series`, and `Parallel` objects is really long and often times unreadable, so I would advise the users to
use pretty-printing (`pprint`) to analyse better. I also added pretty-printing tests for `Series` and `Parallel`.

Then I modified `doit()` method in `Series` class to support MIMO transfer function and added tests related to that. Similar to the rewriter for the SISO transfer function,
I got an idea to also introduce a rewriter for transfer function matrix. It works this way:

``` python
>>> tf1 = TransferFunction(s, s + 1, s)
>>> tf2 = TransferFunction(p + s, s**2 + s + 1, s)
>>> tfm1 = TransferFunctionMatrix([tf1, -tf2], (2, 1), s)
>>> tfm2 = TransferFunctionMatrix([tf2, -tf1], (2, 1), s)
>>> pprint(tfm1)        # it's better to use pprint than use normal printing.
⎡    s     ⎤
⎢  ─────   ⎥
⎢  s + 1   ⎥
⎢          ⎥
⎢  -p - s  ⎥
⎢──────────⎥
⎢ 2        ⎥
⎣s  + s + 1⎦
>>> pprint(tfm2)
⎡  p + s   ⎤
⎢──────────⎥
⎢ 2        ⎥
⎢s  + s + 1⎥
⎢          ⎥
⎢   -s     ⎥
⎢  ─────   ⎥
⎣  s + 1   ⎦
>>> pprint(Parallel(tfm1, tfm2))
⎡    s     ⎤   ⎡  p + s   ⎤
⎢  ─────   ⎥   ⎢──────────⎥
⎢  s + 1   ⎥   ⎢ 2        ⎥
⎢          ⎥   ⎢s  + s + 1⎥
⎢  -p - s  ⎥ + ⎢          ⎥
⎢──────────⎥   ⎢   -s     ⎥
⎢ 2        ⎥   ⎢  ─────   ⎥
⎣s  + s + 1⎦   ⎣  s + 1   ⎦
>>> # Note: The following result will be the same that we get from calling `.doit()`. To expand the internal objects, call `doit()` once again.
>>> pprint(Parallel(tfm1, tfm2).rewrite(TransferFunctionMatrix))    # similarly works for `Series` objects with transfer function matrix in the arguments.
⎡  s       p + s   ⎤
⎢───── + ──────────⎥
⎢s + 1    2        ⎥
⎢        s  + s + 1⎥
⎢                  ⎥
⎢  -p - s      -s  ⎥
⎢────────── + ─────⎥
⎢ 2           s + 1⎥
⎣s  + s + 1        ⎦
```
In the last few days, I also worked on the negation of `Series` and `Parallel` objects and added tests related to that.
Overall, I do feel it was a productive week. Looking forward to the next week which would be challenging for sure, because I have to wrap up this PR soon.
