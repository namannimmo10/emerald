On May 4, I got an email from Google that my proposal with [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) has been accepted! Seriously, that was the best day of my life. I have learned a lot from this open source community from the past 6 months, and I hope to continue that.

The community bonding period for GSoC has concluded. And I have managed to:

* Discuss the basic API design for the control package with my mentors.

* Sync my GSoC blog with planet-sympy.

* Open up an [issue](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/19352) to keep track of the changes and tasks for adding this package.

* properly discuss how the `TransferFunction`, `StateSpace` and `TransferFunctionMatrix` class would look like. Thanks to my mentor [Jason Moore](https://github.com/moorepants) for preparing a [list](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19390#discussion_r429689296) of required functionality to be added in `TransferFunction` class.


In conclusion, I think this community bonding period was indeed productive and important for me as this saves time during the actual coding period. I would like to thank my official mentors ([Ishan](https://github.com/ishanaj), [Nikhil](https://github.com/Sc0rpi0n101) and Jason) and also [S.Y. Lee](https://github.com/sylee957) for constantly guiding me in this crucial period.
