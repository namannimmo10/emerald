This blog post describes my progress in week 8, the last week of Phase 2.
Since we already have a SISO transfer function object available for block diagram algebra, so now, I thought of adding a MIMO transfer function object in this control systems engineering package. The way it works is that we have a matrix of SISO transfer functions, which leads to that object being called a `TransferFunctionMatrix`. Open PR for this week is [19761](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19761).

Here's the work done so far in the aforementioned pull request:

* The implementation was completed recently along with unit-tests. This is how we typically define a MIMO transfer function object now:

```python
tf1 = TransferFunction(...) # tf1, tf2, tf3, tf4 are SISO transfer functions.
tf2 = TransferFunction(...)
tf3 = TransferFunction(...)
tf4 = TransferFunction(...)

# This is a MIMO transfer function.
tfm = TransferFunctionMatrix([tf1, tf2])
# `shape` attribute gives us a tuple - (no. of inputs, no. of outputs)
tfm.shape # this will give (1, 2).

# we can have more than one input..
tfm2 = TransferFunctionMatrix([[tf2, tf1], [tf3, tf4]])
tfm2.shape # gives (2, 2).

# The rest of the attributes are similar to the ones we have in
# `TransferFunction` class.
```

* For MIMO transfer function interconnection, I will use the existing `Series` and `Parallel` classes. I've already modified the `Parallel` class to support this. Similarly, `Series` class needs to be modified in order to have `Series` object when two or more `TransferFunctionMatrix`s are multiplied.
Right now though, addition of transfer function matrices returns a `Parallel` object.

``` python
tfm1 = TransferFunctionMatrix(...)
tfm2 = TransferFunctionMatrix(...)
tfm1 + tfm2 # returns `Parallel(tfm1, tfm2)`
```

I believe it was a productive week overall.
