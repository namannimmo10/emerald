Hi everyone :)
Long time no see.

First of all,
*GOOD NEWS*: My [PR](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19390) on adding a SISO transfer function object is finally merged. Yay!! A robust transfer function object is now available for Single Input Single Output (SISO) block diagram algebra.. Here is the [documentation](https://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/physics/control/lti.html).

I ended up week 5 by adding unit tests for `Feedback` class. So, in week 6, I decided to start off with its implementation. A couple of useful methods like `doit()`, `_eval_rewrite_as_TransferFunction()`, `__neg__()`, etc. were implemented. In case you don't already know - The `Feedback` class is used to represent negative feedback interconnection between two input/output systems.
Here's how we solve a basic block diagram problem (having a negative feedback) with this class:

![block](/emerald/img/block.png "block")
{% highlight python linenos %}
>>> from sympy.physics.control import TransferFunction, Feedback
>>> from sympy.abc import s
>>> G = TransferFunction(2*s**2 + 5*s + 1, s**2 + 2*s + 3, s)
>>> C = TransferFunction(5*(s + 2), s + 10, s)
>>> result = Feedback(G, C)
>>> pprint(result)
        ⎛   2          ⎞       
        ⎜2⋅s  + 5⋅s + 1⎟       
        ⎜──────────────⎟       
        ⎜  2           ⎟       
        ⎝ s  + 2⋅s + 3 ⎠       
───────────────────────────────
    ⎛   2          ⎞           
1   ⎜2⋅s  + 5⋅s + 1⎟ ⎛5⋅s + 10⎞
─ + ⎜──────────────⎟⋅⎜────────⎟
1   ⎜  2           ⎟ ⎝ s + 10 ⎠
    ⎝ s  + 2⋅s + 3 ⎠           
>>> pprint(result.doit()) # this gives the resultant closed loop transfer function in pretty-form.
                        ⎛ 2          ⎞ ⎛   2          ⎞               
               (s + 10)⋅⎝s  + 2⋅s + 3⎠⋅⎝2⋅s  + 5⋅s + 1⎠               
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
⎛         ⎛ 2          ⎞              ⎛   2          ⎞⎞ ⎛ 2          ⎞
⎝(s + 10)⋅⎝s  + 2⋅s + 3⎠ + (5⋅s + 10)⋅⎝2⋅s  + 5⋅s + 1⎠⎠⋅⎝s  + 2⋅s + 3⎠
>>> pprint(result.doit().simplify()) # You can further simplify the transfer function (cancel poles and zeros).
                      ⎛   2          ⎞              
             (s + 10)⋅⎝2⋅s  + 5⋅s + 1⎠              
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
          ⎛   2          ⎞            ⎛ 2          ⎞
5⋅(s + 2)⋅⎝2⋅s  + 5⋅s + 1⎠ + (s + 10)⋅⎝s  + 2⋅s + 3⎠
{% endhighlight %}


We get the same result from `.rewrite(TransferFunction)` as we get from `.doit()` method.

Then, in week 7, I added the documentation for `Series`, `Parallel` classes (which was pending) along with the docs for `Feedback` class.
Also, a new page for Control package was added in sphinx docs. All this time, I also applied the suggestions from the code reviews in these two weeks. 

And finally it was merged on July 12!

In the next few days, I started working on my next task i.e. adding `TransferFunctionMatrix` class in physics.control. [PR-19761](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19761).

That's all for this time!!
