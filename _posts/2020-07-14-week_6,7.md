Hi everyone :)
Long time no see.

First of all,
*GOOD NEWS*: My [PR](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19390) on adding a SISO transfer function object is finally merged. Yay!! A robust transfer function object is now available for Single Input Single Output (SISO) block diagram algebra.. Here is the [documentation](https://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/physics/control/lti.html).

I ended up week 5 by adding unit tests for `Feedback` class. So, in week 6, I decided to start off with its implementation. A couple of useful methods like `doit()`, `_eval_rewrite_as_TransferFunction()`, `__neg__()`, etc. were implemented. In case you don't already know - The `Feedback` class is used to represent negative feedback interconnection between two input/output systems.
Here's how we solve a basic block diagram problem (having a negative feedback) with this class:

![block](/emerald/img/block.png "block")

![example](/emerald/img/example.png "example")

We get the same result from `.rewrite(TransferFunction)` as we get from `.doit()` method.

Then, in week 7, I added the documentation for `Series`, `Parallel` classes (which was pending) along with the docs for `Feedback` class.
Also, a new page for Control package was added in sphinx docs. All this time, I also applied the suggestions from the code reviews in these two weeks. 

And finally it was merged on July 12!

In the next few days, I started working on my next task i.e. adding `TransferFunctionMatrix` class in physics.control. [PR-19761](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19761).

That's all for this time!!
